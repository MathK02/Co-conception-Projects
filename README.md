-Flutter shutter project:Flutter shutter is a computational photography method that rapidly codes the exposure using a pseudo-random sequence of shutter states. This creates a coded motion blur pattern that can be more effectively deblurred compared to traditional uniform motion blur, enabling better reconstruction of moving objects.
